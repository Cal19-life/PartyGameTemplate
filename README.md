# Introduction
This is the base project for our Mario Party styled game. It involves some UI elements for the title screen and board as well as player movement and dice logic (this can be modified throughout the semester). Our goal for the end of this semester is to implement 3-4 minigames and other special events that occur when landing on different spots. Each week, you will be given a task that will not only further the game to completion, but also ease you into working with the Unity Engine and C# scripting.

# Preparation 

Follow these steps to get ready to work with our project:
1) Create a Unity ID [here](https://id.unity.com/).
2) Download and install UnityHub [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). Be aware that UnityHub is not the Unity3D GameEngine, it is a software that helps you download and organize your projects and engines of different versions.
3) Download **Unity 2022.1.0f1** (make sure you have correct version number!) via UnityHub. We will use this version of the engine to develop our games. There is no restriction on what modules you should install.
4) Download GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com/). We will mainly use GitHub as our version control system. If you do not have a GitHub account, please sign up. I also recommend you download Git by following the steps listed [here](https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab01/windows.html#b-install-git).
5) The base project is [here](https://github.com/GuardHei/PartySampleFall2022). Make sure you have forked the project (ATTENTION: Please do FORK instead of CLONE).
6) To open and edit C# files, I recommend you use an IDE, preferably VSCode (as I can help debug and we can do Live Sharing sessions). Other options include JetBrains Rider or Atom.

# Project Structure

The Assets folder under the root directory is where we store assets created for this project, including scripts, sprites, sfx, and etc. You will see different sub-folders inside, with names like Prefabs, Scenes, Scripts and etc. The name of the folder indicates what content should this folder hold. For example, we put all the sfx in the Audios folder, and all the scripts into the Scripts folder. It will be easy for other people to check your work!
